Categories: 
Project

Description:

  Creates a Vivado Design Suite project file (.xpr), or a project file for
  the Vivado Lab Edition (.lpr), in the specified directory.

  For the Vivado Lab Edition: The create_project command has a different
  command syntax, with fewer options, in the Vivado Lab Edition. The options
  that are not supported in Vivado Lab Edition are:

   *  -part - The Vivado Lab Edition project (.lpr) does not specify a target
      part because the current_hw_target and current_hw_device determine the
      target part.

   *  -ip - The Vivado Lab Edition does not define projects for the Managed
      IP flow.

  For the Vivado Design Suite: The default project created for the Vivado
  Design Suite is an RTL project, which defines the project as holding and
  manage RTL source files in the source fileset. The type of project is
  determined by the DESIGN_MODE Property on the source fileset when the
  project is created. To change the project type, use the set_property
  command to set the DESIGN_MODE property on the current_fileset as follows:

   *  RTL Project - set_property DESIGN_MODE RTL [current_fileset]

   *  Netlist Project - set_property DESIGN_MODE GateLvl [current_fileset]

   *  I/O Planning Project - set_property DESIGN_MODE PinPlanning
      [current_fileset]

  Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: System-Level Design Entry
  (UG895) for more information on the different types of projects.

  This command returns a transcript of its process and the name of the
  created project, or returns an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -part <arg> - (Optional) Specifies the Xilinx part to be used for the
  project. This can be changed after the project is created. If the -part
  option is not specified, the default part will be used. This option is not
  supported in Vivado Lab Edition.

  -force - (Optional) This option is required to overwrite an existing
  project. If the project name is already define in the specified <dir> then
  you must also specify the -force option for the tool to overwrite the
  existing project.

  Note: If the existing project is currently open in the tool, the new
  project will overwrite the existing project on the disk, but both projects
  will be opened in the tool. In this case you should probably run the
  close_project command prior to running create_project.

  -in_memory - (Optional) Specifies that the project should be created in the
  in-memory database of the Vivado Design Suite to support the Non-Project
  design flow. This project will not result in a project file or directory
  structure being written to disk. The purpose of the in-memory project is to
  allow properties usually associated with a project-based design to be
  associated with the in-memory design of the non-project design flow.

  Note: The use of -in_memory is not part of the standard non-project design
  flow, and may cause unexpected behaviors in the Vivado tools. For more
  information on Non-Project Mode refer to the Vivado Design Suite User
  Guide: Design Flows Overview (UG892).

  -ip - (Optional) Create a project for the Managed IP flow for exploring IP
  in the IP catalog, customizing IP, and managing a repository of configured
  IP. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Designing with IP (UG896)
  for more information on the Managed IP flow. This option is not supported
  in Vivado Lab Edition.

  -rtl_kernel - (Optional) Specifies the creation of the project is for use
  in defining an RTL kernel for the Vitis core development kit.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <name> - (Required) This argument does not require a parameter name,
  however, it must appear before the specified <dir>. Since these commands do
  not have parameters, the tool interprets the first argument as <name> and
  uses the second argument as <dir>. A project file is created <name>.xpr,
  (or <name>.lpr) and a project data folder is also created <name>.data and
  both are written into the specified directory <dir>.

  Note: The project file created by the tool is an RTL source file by
  default. You must use the set_property command to set the DESIGN_MODE
  property to change the project from an RTL source project to a Netlist or
  an I/O Pin Planning project.

  <dir> - (Optional) This argument specifies the directory name to write the
  new project file into. If the specified directory does not exist a new
  directory will be created. If the directory is specified with the complete
  path, the tool uses the specified path name. However, if <dir> is specified
  without a path, the tool looks for or creates the directory in the current
  working directory, or the directory from which the tool was launched.

  Note: When creating a project in GUI-mode, the tool appends the <name> to
  the <dir> and creates a project directory <dir>/<name> and places the new
  project file and project data folder into that project directory.

Examples:

  When run from the Vivado Design Suite, the following example creates a
  project called project1.xpr in a directory called myDesigns:

    create_project project1 myDesigns 
    

  Note: Because the <dir> is specified as the folder name only, the tool will
  create the project in the current working directory, or the directory from
  which the tool was launched.

  When run from the Vivado Lab Edition, this example creates a project called
  project1.lpr in a directory called myDesigns:

    create_project project1 myDesigns 
    

  The following example creates a project called Proj1 in a directory called
  FPGA in C:/Designs. In addition, the tool will overwrite an existing
  project if one is found to exist in the specified location. In the second
  and third lines, the location of -force is changed to show the flexibility
  of argument placement.

    create_project Proj1 C:/Designs/FPGA -force  
    -or-  
    create_project Proj1 -force C:/Designs/FPGA  
    -or-  
    create_project -force Proj1 C:/Designs/FPGA  
     
    

  Note: In all cases the first argument without a preceding keyword is
  interpreted as the <name> variable, and the second argument without a
  preceding keyword is the <dir> variable.

  The following example creates a project for the Manage IP flow in the
  specified directory:

    create_project -ip manageIP C:/Data 
    

  The following example creates a new project called pin_project, and then
  sets the DESIGN_MODE property as required for an I/O Pin Planning project,
  and finally opens an IO design:

    create_project pin_project C:/Designs/PinPlanning  
    set_property design_mode PinPlanning [current_fileset]    
    open_io_design -name io_1
